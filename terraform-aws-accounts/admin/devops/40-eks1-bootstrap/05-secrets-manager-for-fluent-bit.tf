# Here we create the (empty) AWS resource in AWS Secrets Manager.
# We do NOT populate this resource with any name:value pairs of secret strings (e.g., passwords, tokens, private keys).
# The population of such secret strings are performed by hand (e.g., via AWS Admin Console).


# Troubleshooting:
#   Problem: If this secret is deleted ('tf destroy -target ...') then attempted to be recreated right away, we'd get:
#               â”‚ Error: error creating Secrets Manager Secret:
#               | InvalidRequestException: You can't create this secret because a secret with this name is already scheduled for deletion.

resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "fluent-bit" {
  # Prefix every secret name with the team's name so that the full ARN looks like:
  #   "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:106628749228:secret:foundation-team/artifactory/kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson-wKyoZg"
  # That allows prefix-based IAM policies like this:
  #   - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_examples.html#auth-and-access_examples_wildcard
  # i.e., it allows us potentially (maybe in the near future) to construct an IAM policy such that
  # each team has access only to the team's own secrets but not to other team's secrets.
  # The slash ('/') otherwise has no significance to AWS Secrets Manager. It's just our own naming convention to
  # facilitate (future) wildcard match when constructing the IAM policy.
