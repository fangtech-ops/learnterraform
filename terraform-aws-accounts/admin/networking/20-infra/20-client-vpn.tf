  # that wouldn't be a stable list. The list would change each time we add/delete a spoke VPC.

  # which means client_cidr_block cannot overlap with destination_cidr_block.
  #
  # So, our CIDRs below is 10.0.0.0/8 minus the CIDR planned for the 'networking' account (including client_cidr_block=10.70.56.0/21).
  # This is a stable list that covers all existing and future AWS VPCs.
  #
  # To restrict which spoke VPCs this VPN can connect to, use:
  #   - Routing table for jump-vpc, i.e., "aws_route" in ./20-transit-gateway.tf
  #   - Security Groups in each spoke VPC

# ................................. SSL Cert ..........................................................
# We cannot use the following AWS module for creating a *private* cert:
#   - https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/acm/aws/3.2.0 (latest as of Nov 2021)
# because it is hard coded to create a *public* cert, i.e., a cert signed by a CA chain that
# ends in a well-known public root CA such as Digicert.
# 
# Navar has a public cert `*.narvar.com` in the ACM of the old Prod account `533313119160`.
# That existing cert would have been good except:
#   - It is in a different account than our current account, but AWS doesn't have the feature for cross-account sharing of cert.
#   - If we import that cert (it is not an ACM-generated cert, but an imported cert to begin with) to our current account,
#     then we'd have to worry about manually renewing it every year in this account as well as in the old Prod account.
#     That's repetitive manual work and is easy to forget.
#
# Besides, we don't need a *public* server cert. Almost all the literature (AWS docs, 3rd-party blogs, open source
# Terraform Registry modules, etc.) implies (although not explicitly asserted -- I think very few people actually understand it) 
# that AWS Client VPN needs a *public* server cert. That is not true. In fact, a closer scrutiny of the AWS official tutorial
# reveals that *private* server cert can do the job (although the tutorial's wording is vague):
#   - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/cvpn-getting-started.html#cvpn-getting-started-certs
#   - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/client-authentication.html#awsui-tabs-0-linux%2Fmacos-panel
#
# The server's CA cert (either a root CA or an intermediate CA) is automatically embedded 
# in the client-side config file (default file name `downloaded-client-config.ovpn` which can be downloaded from AWS Admin Console.)
# This is analogous to importing a (private) CA into a browser or a Java keystore. Therefore, whether the CA is
# public or private is irrelevant because the VPN client software is configured to accept any server cert that is issued by that CA.


# Create a private server cert (for AWS Client VPN endpoint) which is issued by an existing private root CA.
# Even though our CA is private, we still need to use "aws_acm_certificate" instead of "aws_acmpca_certificate"
# despite the latter name "acmpca" stands for "ACM *Private* CA". The reason is explained here:
#   - https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/5550#issuecomment-413565363
resource "aws_acm_certificate" "client-vpn-devops-server-cert" {

  # This value doesn't matter. 
  # It is a meaningless placeholder to satisfy X.509 format, having nothing to do with DNS or HTTP.
  # The VPN client software doesn't look up this DNS domain_name at runtime, and the VPN connection isn't HTTP(s).
  domain_name = "narvar.local"

  # Although the resource to be created is "aws_acm_certificate" (rather than "aws_acmpca_certificate" as explained above), 
  # the CA is still the *private* CA as shown here.
  certificate_authority_arn = data.aws_acmpca_certificate_authority.private-ca-root.id
}
