# We would very much like to save .terraform.lock.hcl to Github in order to take advantage of
# the benefits it provides, but we're encountering a terraform bug (outstanding as of Dec 1, 2021):
#   - https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28041
#
# In our case (Narvar), the issue arises when this file is generated on our laptop (MacOS) which is
# a different platform from the Atlantis pod (Alpine Linux). So, Atlantis will fail to 'terraform init'
# if this MacOS-generated file exists in Github. The terraform error (shown as Github PR comment) is:
#
#         Initializing provider plugins...
#         - terraform.io/builtin/terraform is built in to Terraform
#         - Finding hashicorp/aws versions matching ">= 2.23.0, ~> 3.64"...
#         - Finding latest version of hashicorp/null...
#         - Using hashicorp/aws v3.68.0 from the shared cache directory
#         - Using hashicorp/null v3.1.0 from the shared cache directory
#
#         Error: Failed to install provider from shared cache
#
#         Error while importing hashicorp/aws v3.68.0 from the shared cache directory:
#         the provider cache at .terraform/providers has a copy of
#         registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws 3.68.0 that doesn't match any of the
#         checksums recorded in the dependency lock file.
#
# So, to avoid the terraform bug, we don't save this lock file to Github.
