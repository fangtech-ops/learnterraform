# 1. Perform Common Bootstrap Tasks

See Git repo `terraform-aws-control-tower:/50-orgs-and-accounts/README.md` for common tasks to be performed for every new account.


# 2. Run Terraform

If haven't done so, configure your laptop according to the root level [README.md](../../../README.md).

Then, run the terraform in this folder:

```console
  ## Switch to local account via a command alias (as we do below) or `export AWS_PROFILE=dev71`
$ dev71

  ## Ensure that we're targetting the correct AWS account
$ aws sts get-caller-identity
{
    "UserId": "AR......IW:vincent.yin@narvar.com",
    "Account": "342812538696",                   <=== 'dev71'
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::342812538696:assumed-role/AWSReservedSSO_AWSAdministratorAccess_c07bf92e3e331fc3/vincent.yin@narvar.com"
}

$ terraform apply
```
